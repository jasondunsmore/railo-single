  #### Welcome to Railo
  This will deploy a single Linux server running
  [Railo](http://www.getrailo.org/index.cfm/documentation/).
  This deployment does not come with any preconfigured Railo applications.
  You will need to [add sites to the server manually](https://github.com/getrailo/railo/wiki/Installation-InstallerDocumentation-LinAddingSites).

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Admin Interface
  The admin interface for Railo runs on port 8888 which isn't exposed
  by default by this deployment. If you didn't provide an admin user
  ip address during setup, login using ssh and issue the following command
  where <ip> is replaced by your IP address:
  'ufw allow from <ip> to any port 8888'

  #### Railo Service
  Railo can be controlled using the standard 'service' command.

  service railo_ctl status
  service railo_ctl stop
  service railo_ctl start
  service railo_ctl restart
